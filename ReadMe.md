# Multiple React apps

Shows how to run multiple independent web apps side by side, each with it's own
react-router.

`one-app` and `another-app` were created with `create-react-app`.
`nx-app` was created with `nx` and lives in a pnpm monorepo.

To see it in action:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```
